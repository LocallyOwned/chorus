# Introduction

## **Chorus - A Community Currency Protocol by Tellor**

Chorus is a structure for enabling anyone to create and issue custom and trust-minimized semi-stablecoins called “Notes” for use in their own ecosystem. 

### **Background**

Throughout history, nations have used currency and monetary policy to further the unique goals of their economy.  By allowing the creation of non-state-backed currencies with flexible monetary policies, Chorus can be used to support the specific goals of individual communities and organizations.  By rethinking incentive structures to focus efforts on cooperation in targeted areas, creating a flexible system for community currencies can help empower localities, traditional companies, and virtual organizations to help develop and strengthen their network’s interactions.
